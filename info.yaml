  wokwi_id:    366318576852367361        # If using wokwi, set this to your project's ID

# If using an HDL, set wokwi_id as 0 and uncomment and list your source files here. 
# Source files must be in ./src and you must list each source file separately
#  source_files:        
#    - counter.v
#    - decoder.v
#  top_module:  "tt_um_example"      # Put the name of your top module here, must start with "tt_um_". Make it unique by prepending your github username

# How many tiles your design occupies? A single tile is about 167x108 uM.
# Before changing this, please reach out to us on discord to discuss your design.
  tiles: "1x1"    # Valid values: 1x1, 1x2, 2x2, 4x2 or 8x2

# Keep a track of the submission yaml
yaml_version: 3.5

# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.
#
# Here is a great example: https://github.com/davidsiaw/tt02-davidsiaw-stackcalc/blob/38c5647f83aad2aec675d566aa3d67b98f0aac81/info.yaml
